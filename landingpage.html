          <p class="text-justify">Virat Kohli is one of the most iconic cricketers of the modern era, known for his aggressive style, unmatched consistency, and leadership. Born on November 5, 1988, in Delhi, India, Kohli rose through the ranks from U-19 cricket, leading India to victory in the 2008 ICC U-19 World Cup. He made his international debut for India in 2008, and quickly established himself as a top-order batsman.
            As captain, Kohli led India to significant victories, particularly in Test cricket, where he became the most successful Indian captain with 40 wins. His aggressive approach and relentless pursuit of excellence have redefined Indian cricket. Beyond statistics, Kohli's fitness, passion, and work ethic have inspired a generation of cricketers globally. His achievements on the field, combined with his influence off it, make him a true legend of the game.
